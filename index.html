<p>NYC transportation ecosystem is dynamic and extensive. Every day, 54 million tourists and 8 million locals use public and private transportation to navigate the myriad of streets in this mega-city. Thus, the NYC transportation system has evolved over the past few decades to encompass a labyrinth of interconnected transit mediums that can almost seem daunting to a stranger. The purpose of this project is to collate data from motor vehicle collisions over the past two and a half years and analyze it. Delving into the various intricacies of data will enable us to look for various correlations, causations and anomalies and give a truly unique perspective.</p>

<p>NYC locals tout their robust transport system. While getting around Manhattan is easy and relatively convenient, the task is challenging in other boroughs. As of today, 5600 buses transport 784 million annual riders and 6282 subway cars carry over 1 billion people every year. Furthermore, the cityâ€™s 46% car ownership rate is among the lowest in the country. These factors combined have resulted in 55% of New Yorkers relying on public transport with a mean commute time of 40 minutes. While most American cities have a mean commute time of 24 minutes (approx.), 16 minutes longer for 4.4 million people to get to work every day on public transport causes major congestion. The unfortunate realization is that public transportation has to work in tandem with population growth to prevent overcrowding of this necessary resource.</p>
