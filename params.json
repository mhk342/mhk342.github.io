{"name":"NYC Accidents","tagline":"by Matthew Kwong, Uday Karri, Kunal Jalan","body":"### Our Goal\r\nNYC transportation ecosystem is dynamic and extensive. Every day, 54 million tourists and 8 million locals use public and private transportation to navigate the myriad of streets in this mega-city. Thus, the NYC transportation system has evolved over the past few decades to encompass a labyrinth of interconnected transit mediums that can almost seem daunting to a stranger. The purpose of this project is to collate data from motor vehicle collisions over the past two and a half years and analyze it. Delving into the various intricacies of data will enable us to look for various correlations, causations and anomalies and give a truly unique perspective.\r\n\r\n### Our Data\r\nOur main dataset used in this project is NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision taken from NYC Open Data. This dataset extends from 7/1/12 - 4/28/15; however, for a more comprehensive and concrete analysis we have focused on 2013 and 2014. There have been 575,155 Accidents over this time period, which means approximately 560 Accidents a day. Our secondary dataset is NYC Population Projections by Age/Sex & Borough, which allows us to analyze demographics of accident prone areas. Our tertiary dataset is a list published by the Gothamist. It consists of all bars that close at 4am by zip code. This dataset allows us to correlate drunk driving and accidents.\r\n\r\n### New York's Transportation Ecosystem\r\nNYC locals tout their robust transport system. While getting around Manhattan is easy and relatively convenient, the task is challenging in other boroughs. As of today, 5600 buses transport 784 million annual riders and 6282 subway cars carry over 1 billion people every year. Furthermore, the city’s 46% car ownership rate is among the lowest in the country. These factors combined have resulted in 55% of New Yorkers relying on public transport with a mean commute time of 40 minutes. While most American cities have a mean commute time of 24 minutes (approx.), 16 minutes longer for 4.4 million people to get to work every day on public transport causes major congestion. The unfortunate realization is that public transportation has to work in tandem with population growth to prevent overcrowding of this necessary resource.\r\n\r\n![Major City Commute](http://i.imgur.com/KElV52L.png)\r\nSource: city-data\r\n\r\n### Base Case\r\n\r\nNYPD Motor Vehicle Collision is a file that has over half a million lines of data. This raw data, itself can be misleading and not representative. For instance, in the 2 graphs below we see the time by hour on the horizontal axis and the number of deaths/injuries on the vertical axis. In the case of the first graph we can see that injuries peak at 4PM and 5PM with a spike at 8AM. This follows the underlying universal assumption that injuries increase during rush hour. However, the second graph shows jumps at 4AM and 5PM. This correlates with the intrinsic fact that people drive fast at night because traffic is reduced. \r\n\r\n\r\n![Injured vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/mruA39y.png)\r\n![Deceased vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/E2TX7ij.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this data may seem to correlate with general knowledge it presents only half the picture, to gain a true understanding, we will need to further dissect the data.\r\n\r\n### Base Case Adjusted by Days (Injuries)\r\nTo scrutinize previous results, we used a combination of Weekday() and the Vlookup() to convert the dates on the list to days. Sorting data on pivot tables by days allowed us to glean some interesting information. In the graphs below we can see that the injuries from motor vehicle collisions have been sorted by day with time on the horizontal axis and number of people on the vertical axis. This showed us that injuries by collisions are somewhat similar. While Monday shows a spike on morning and evening rush hour, Sunday shows a slight uptick at 4AM with a peak at 4PM. This data correlates with previous analyses and proves that while day might play a factor in determining injuries, time is the most important variable. \r\n\r\n![Injuries on Weekdays](http://i.imgur.com/ANbVcfK.png)\r\n![Injuries on Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/VsnJrNl.png)\r\n\r\n### Base Case Adjusted by Days (Deaths)\r\nUsing the same method as above, we now turn to deaths caused by motor vehicle collisions. Looking at both graphs, we can see that Monday, a weekday, has spikes at 12PM and 4PM, with peaks at 6PM and 7PM. Interestingly, just as injuries start to go down on a Monday (around 6PM) the number of deaths start to rise. However, the most interesting data can be gleaned from deaths on weekend. The number of deaths, peak at 2AM on a Saturday and gradually go down only for a typical 4PM rush hour spike. Only after sorting the data, first by hour and then by day, do we realize the importance of not using raw numbers to jump to conclusions. It is now clear that most deaths on a weekend happen at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Deaths on Weekday](http://i.imgur.com/N22AYXS.png)\r\n![Deaths of Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/Bdjo6uv.png)\r\n\r\n### Is Alcohol the Answer?\r\nAfter observing late night peaks in death by collision on the weekend, we decided to use the Gothamist dataset to see if there is a correlation and causation effect between late-night bars and deaths from accidents. Sorting both datasets by zip-code and creating a pivot table with the combined datasets, allowed us to create a linear regression in a scatter plot. The results were surprising! An R^2 of .003 conclusively proved that bars and driving deaths are not correlated, at least by zip-code. \r\n\r\n![Death vs Bar Closing Times](http://i.imgur.com/u07Vd5g.png)\r\n\r\n### Brooklyn Is the Culprit!\r\nAfter the alcohol test was inconclusive, we used the NYC Population Projection by Age/Sex and Borough dataset; and, turned to geography and demographics for helping us understand motor vehicle collisions better. Interestingly, with 2.6 Million people Brooklyn, NYC’s most populous borough, accounted for nearly 30,000 accidents that resulted in death or injury. This number was significantly larger than the 20,000 accidents that have occurred in Queens (2.3 Million residents). Clearly Brooklyn is an outlier in the chart below, with the most number of fatal accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Brooklyn Is the Culprit](http://i.imgur.com/oonM9lx.png)\r\n\r\n###  Analyzing Brooklyn \r\nNow we know the following: Deaths from motor vehicle collisions peak at 2AM on a weekend. Brooklyn has the worst road safety with the highest number of fatal accidents. The location of bars have no correlation with any of this. Brooklyn was now broken down and analyzed on some rather specific verticals. Using a combination of pivot tables and Max(), we learnt that the most pedestrian accidents sorted by zip-code and time occur in zip 11207 at 6PM. In a similar fashion, it was discovered that the most cyclist accidents take place in zip 11206 at 6PM and the most motorist collisions happen in zip 11207 at 6PM. Furthermore, zip 11207 has the highest injuries and zip 11236 has the most deaths. Brooklyn leads in all the stats. Zip 11207, which seems to lead NYC in many verticals, is essentially Brownsville; dubbed the murder capital of New York City, Brownsville reputation seems to precede it.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Analyzing Brooklyn](http://i.imgur.com/K46Ng2Z.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what makes Brooklyn the most accident prone borough in New York City? Looking back at demographics, Brooklyn has the highest elderly population and the largest population of people under 18. Insurance typically charges high premiums to both these groups because they have repeatedly proved to be the worst drivers. In this case, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that these people could be partially responsible for the increased collisions in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n### The Solution (Big Black Picture)\r\nReverting back to the initial concern, we still haven’t been able to analyze the reason for late night deaths from collisions on a weekend. While we proved that the location of bars aren’t important and Brooklyn is accident-prone at 6PM, a conclusion has been evasive. However, a solution need not be! Speeding Cameras are the future, the following is a map from a local TV station that has pinpointed the exact location of these cameras in the city. Looking at the data we arrive at the answer. Deaths are occurring because of speed. 1 out of 10 people survive a crash at 40 MPH while 9 out of 10 people can survive one at 20 MPH. People drive too fast and night. Furthermore, In 2014 471,625 speeding tickets were issued by speed cameras compared to 117,767 speeding tickets issued by officers. Lastly, vehicle crashes near cameras declined by 3.9% and crashes with injuries near cameras declined by 13.4%. It is important to note that cameras, placed throughout the city can regulate traffic and speed, resulting in lower collisions across.\r\n\r\n\r\n![The Solution?](http://i.imgur.com/qB6kQL3.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
