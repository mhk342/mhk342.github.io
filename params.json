{"name":"NYC Accidents","tagline":"by Matthew Kwong, Uday Karri, Kunal Jalan","body":"### Our Goal\r\nNYC transportation ecosystem is dynamic and extensive. Every day, 54 million tourists and 8 million locals use public and private transportation to navigate the myriad of streets in this mega-city. Thus, the NYC transportation system has evolved over the past few decades to encompass a labyrinth of interconnected transit mediums that can almost seem daunting to a stranger. The purpose of this project is to collate data from motor vehicle collisions over the past two and a half years and analyze it. Delving into the various intricacies of data will enable us to look for various correlations, causations and anomalies and give a truly unique perspective.\r\n\r\n### Our Data\r\nOur main dataset used in this project is NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision taken from NYC Open Data. This dataset extends from 7/1/12 - 4/28/15; however, for a more comprehensive and concrete analysis we have focused on 2013 and 2014. There have been 575,155 Accidents over this time period, which means approximately 560 Accidents a day. Our secondary dataset is NYC Population Projections by Age/Sex & Borough, which allows us to analyze demographics of accident prone areas. Our tertiary dataset is a list published by the Gothamist. It consists of all bars that close at 4am by zip code. This dataset allows us to correlate drunk driving and accidents.\r\n\r\n### New York's Transportation Ecosystem\r\nNYC locals tout their robust transport system. While getting around Manhattan is easy and relatively convenient, the task is challenging in other boroughs. As of today, 5600 buses transport 784 million annual riders and 6282 subway cars carry over 1 billion people every year. Furthermore, the cityâ€™s 46% car ownership rate is among the lowest in the country. These factors combined have resulted in 55% of New Yorkers relying on public transport with a mean commute time of 40 minutes. While most American cities have a mean commute time of 24 minutes (approx.), 16 minutes longer for 4.4 million people to get to work every day on public transport causes major congestion. The unfortunate realization is that public transportation has to work in tandem with population growth to prevent overcrowding of this necessary resource.\r\n\r\n![Major City Commute](http://i.imgur.com/KElV52L.png)\r\nSource: city-data\r\n\r\n### Base Case\r\n\r\nNYPD Motor Vehicle Collision is a file that has over half a million lines of data. This raw data, itself can be misleading and not representative. For instance, in the 2 graphs below we see the time by hour on the horizontal axis and the number of deaths/injuries on the vertical axis. In the case of the first graph we can see that injuries peak at 4PM and 5PM with a spike at 8AM. This follows the underlying universal assumption that injuries increase during rush hour. However, the second graph shows jumps at 4AM and 5PM. This correlates with the intrinsic fact that people drive fast at night because traffic is reduced. \r\n\r\n\r\n![Injured vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/mruA39y.png)\r\n![Deceased vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/E2TX7ij.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this data may seem to correlate with general knowledge it presents only half the picture, to gain a true understanding, we will need to further dissect the data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Injuries on Weekdays](http://i.imgur.com/ANbVcfK.png)\r\n![Injuries on Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/VsnJrNl.png)\r\n![Deaths on Weekday](http://i.imgur.com/N22AYXS.png)\r\n![Deaths of Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/Bdjo6uv.png)\r\n![Death vs Bar Closing Times](http://i.imgur.com/u07Vd5g.png)\r\n![Brooklyn Is the Culprit](http://i.imgur.com/oonM9lx.png)\r\n![Analyzing Brooklyn](http://i.imgur.com/K46Ng2Z.png)\r\n![The Solution?](http://i.imgur.com/qB6kQL3.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
