{"name":"NYC Accidents","tagline":"by Matthew Kwong, Uday Karri, Kunal Jalan","body":"### Our Goal\r\nNYC transportation ecosystem is dynamic and extensive. Every day, 54 million tourists and 8 million locals use public and private transportation to navigate the myriad of streets in this mega-city. Thus, the NYC transportation system has evolved over the past few decades to encompass a labyrinth of interconnected transit mediums that can almost seem daunting to a stranger. The purpose of this project is to collate data from motor vehicle collisions over the past two and a half years and analyze it. Delving into the various intricacies of data will enable us to look for various correlations, causations and anomalies and give a truly unique perspective.\r\n\r\n### New York's Transportation Ecosystem\r\n![Major City Commute](http://imgur.com/KElV52L.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
