{"name":"NYC Accidents","tagline":"by Matthew Kwong, Uday Karri, Kunal Jalan","body":"### Our Goal\r\nNYC transportation ecosystem is dynamic and extensive. Every day, 54 million tourists and 8 million locals use public and private transportation to navigate the myriad of streets in this mega-city. Thus, the NYC transportation system has evolved over the past few decades to encompass a labyrinth of interconnected transit mediums that can almost seem daunting to a stranger. The purpose of this project is to collate data from motor vehicle collisions over the past two and a half years and analyze it. Delving into the various intricacies of data will enable us to look for various correlations, causations and anomalies and give a truly unique perspective.\r\n\r\n### New York's Transportation Ecosystem\r\n![Major City Commute](http://i.imgur.com/KElV52L.png)\r\nSource: city-data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Injured vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/mruA39y.png)\r\n![Deceased vs Time](http://i.imgur.com/E2TX7ij.png)\r\n![Injuries on Weekdays](http://i.imgur.com/ANbVcfK.png)\r\n![Injuries on Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/VsnJrNl.png)\r\n![Deaths on Weekday](http://i.imgur.com/N22AYXS.png)\r\n![Deaths of Weekend](http://i.imgur.com/Bdjo6uv.png)\r\n![Death vs Bar Closing Times](http://i.imgur.com/u07Vd5g.png)\r\n![Brooklyn Is the Culprit](http://i.imgur.com/oonM9lx.png)\r\n![Analyzing Brooklyn](http://i.imgur.com/K46Ng2Z.png)\r\n![The Solution?](http://i.imgur.com/qB6kQL3.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
